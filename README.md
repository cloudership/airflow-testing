# Airflow Testing

A project to test Apache Airflow and build some DAGs for learning purposes.

It uses the default Docker setup for running (using `docker compose`).

## Start

```shell
./start.sh
```

## Usage

Use `./airflow.sh` instead of the `airflow` CLI - it runs the `airflow` command in the right container.
